# Vite protoypes

This is starter project for creating protyping using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

The project is built with:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Compiles JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS (PostCSS) files. You can [add support for other CSS Pre-processors like SASS or Less](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors) without much hassle.
- [Plop](https://plopjs.com): You can generate new prototype folder and files using a single command. [See](#create-a-new-prototype).

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # Install dependencies

$ npm run dev # Start development server
```

### Create a new prototype

```bash
$ npm run new-prototype # Prompts for new directory name and generates new project.
```
